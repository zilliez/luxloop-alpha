# LuxLoop: Project Alpha â€” Proof of Vision

## Overview
LuxLoop is a humanitarian DePIN protocol that transforms idle public infrastructure (like streetlamps) into intelligent, revenue-generating nodes on a decentralized network.

## Objectives
- Activate streetlamps as DePIN nodes operating from 7PM to 7AM
- Capture environmental data (noise, air quality, motion)
- Reward cities with on-chain incentives
- Enable real-time infrastructure intelligence
- Integrate with AI for early warning systems (earthquakes, crime, congestion)
- Remain energy-efficient and privacy-respecting

## Technologies
- Substrate Framework
- peaq Machine ID Protocol
- Off-chain workers / oracles
- Governance pallets (democracy, collective)
- XCM for cross-chain integration (Astar, Moonbeam)

## Setup
This is a vision protocol document. No codebase yet.  
LuxLoop is blueprint-ready and pilotable in small cities.  
See `docs/LuxLoop_Alpha_Proof_of_Vision.pdf` for full artefact.

## Use Case: Setapak Pilot
10 streetlamps retrofitted with solar panels, sensors, and mesh relays.  
Daytime: solar grid feed, mesh relay, edge compute leasing.  
Nighttime: anomaly detection, smart lighting, emergency alerts.  
All activity logged on Substrate chain.  
Rewards distributed in $PEAQ.

## Status
Blueprint-ready.  
Beta calibration in progress.  
Full artefact will be modularized when resonance is ready.
