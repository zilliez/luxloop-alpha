# LuxLoop Alpha

**Humanitarian DePIN protocol for cities ‚Äì blueprint-ready, built on Substrate.**

LuxLoop Alpha is a processor-native artefact earn designed to activate survival blueprints in urban environments. It is not a product‚Äîit is a living audit. Built using the Polkadot SDK and Substrate, LuxLoop modularizes decentralized infrastructure (DePIN) for small cities, starting with a pilot in Setapak, Kuala Lumpur.

## üåê Overview & Objectives

LuxLoop Alpha aims to:
- Activate generational resonance through decentralized public infrastructure.
- Enable communities to audit and modularize their own data, voice, and survival logic.
- Provide a blueprint-ready protocol for humanitarian DePIN deployment in urban contexts.

This artefact is submitted under the **User-centric Apps** and **Polkadot Tinkerers** themes.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Polkadot SDK** (Substrate)
- **Rust** (conceptual layer)
- **DePIN architecture**
- **Modular blueprint logic** (non-code artefact earn)

---

## üöÄ Setup & Usage

This is a **blueprint artefact**, not a deployable app. The repo contains:
- `docs/LuxLoop_Alpha_Proof_of_Vision.pdf`: Full artefact earn and pilot vision.
- `README.md`: Modular breakdown of objectives, resonance, and audit logic.

No installation required. This artefact is designed for audit, calibration, and blueprint activation.

## üìç Use Case: Setapak Pilot

Setapak, Kuala Lumpur is the calibration ground for LuxLoop Alpha. The protocol is designed to:
- Modularize local data and voice as sovereign artefacts.
- Activate community-driven infrastructure audits.
- Serve as a replicable model for other urban processors.

## üìÑ License

This artefact is currently under audit. License to be determined post-calibration.

## üß† Notes from the Builder

> ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not here to win. This is my first submission‚Äînot to validate, but to show LuxLoop Alpha as an artefact earn from Malaysia‚Äîmodularized for survival, not for applause. Every fragments in this repo is a living imprint from my processor.‚Äù

## Setup
This is a vision protocol document. No codebase yet.  
LuxLoop is blueprint-ready and pilotable in small cities.  
See `docs/LuxLoop_Alpha_Proof_of_Vision.pdf` for full artefact.

## Use Case: Setapak Pilot
10 streetlamps retrofitted with solar panels, sensors, and mesh relays.  
Daytime: solar grid feed, mesh relay, edge compute leasing.  
Nighttime: anomaly detection, smart lighting, emergency alerts.  
All activity logged on Substrate chain.  
Rewards distributed in $PEAQ.

## Status
Blueprint-ready.  
Beta calibration in progress.  
Full artefact will be modularized when resonance is ready.
