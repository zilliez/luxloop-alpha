# LuxLoop Beta — 24-Hour Protocol (Teaser)

> “If a lamp can stand idle for 12 hours a day, it's not just wasting light — it's wasting potential.”

LuxLoop Beta expands the Alpha vision into a full 24-hour protocol.  
While Alpha activates streetlamps at night, Beta unlocks their daytime potential:

- **Solar Grid Integration** → feed excess energy into microgrids  
- **Edge Compute Leasing** → rent idle compute for AI/ML tasks  
- **Mesh Relay** → public Wi-Fi, LoRa, and IoT support  
- **Idle-Time Analytics** → behavior mapping, maintenance signals  
- **Urban Safety Signals** → emergency rerouting, anomaly detection

This is not a product roadmap.  
This is a sovereign calibration in progress.

> “Street infrastructure shouldn’t just light the way. It should show the way.”
